# games

The idea here is to learn about html5 by create a series of tools to help me beat my daughter at Catan and hopefully sharing some lines of code with here too.

## Catan
The games repo holds a catan generator.  It will build a board with game tokens.  It will also tell you the best placements based on token tics.  But there is a lot more to a decision as to where to place your first settlements then just the total numbers of token tics.

Future Features to include...
..* Sea Ports
..* User built map
..* Rule base decisions
